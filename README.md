# pear 🍐
A toy programming language.

Based on the Lox language (the tree-walk interpreter version) from Bob Nystrom's great book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html). 

The original was implemented in Java and I wanted myself to understand the contents of the book better, so I worked in a language I hadn't really worked with before -  Python.
